Can you please help catch-up Suprija with whatever you have done so far in the following order:

(a)	Load Testing for application services
(b)	Performance (response time) for app-services
(c)	Core Platform Integration Testing Automation
(d)	App-services Integration Testing Automation
(e)	Any Documentation that we have built around this in the past.

Please feel free to juggle the order, add/modify items from the above list.



-----------------------------------------------------------



(a)	Load Testing for application services
(b)	Performance (response time) for app-services
(c)	Update Test Evidence Results document on performance Testing
(d)	Core Platform Integration Testing Automation
(e)	App-services Integration Testing Automation
(f)	Prepare Test result evidence document for Core Platform Integration Testing


@ Suprija: let catch up tomorrow  and discuss on Load Testing for application services ,meanwhile please go through Junit Tutorials .Hope below link would be helpful
“https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTt7pyY-o0eltq14glaG5dg/playlists?shelf_id=4&view=50&sort=dd


--------------------------------------------------------------------

 will start with executing Jmeter Scripts execution with kerbrose  turned on and  also document the same.

below access required 

•	Account in  cca.intranet.com
•	Access to norgenhdpdev02,norgenhdpdev01  and stage servers

+Bob

Jonas, Gene, Amitava – 

This is an early indicator based on what was observed in our Dev environment as part of the Load Testing. Wanted to share it with you ASAP to see if this is expected or do you notice some anomaly here. Understand that it is on our Dev environment but on a relative scale with respect to other requests these deviations have been noticed and hence wanted to get your expert insight into it.

Let us know if this is something we need to go after or we would be good (especially, when we move to a production-grade box).

Thanks,
-Karthik

Hi All ,

Please find the observation on below workload distribution.

SNO	Total No of Users for   Get Claims<Claim Id, RootId, MemberID, schema >	No of Users for Claim Id	No of Users for Claim Root Id	No of Users for member Id	No of Users for Schema	Min Response Time in ms	Max Response Time in ms	Throughput
In seconds	AVG KB/Sec
1	100	30 	30	30	10	7470	7600	13.2/sec	26421.3
2	100	70	10	10	10	236	2730	17.7/sec	24420.4
3	100	10	70	10	10	49	17867	7.0/sec	74454.2
4	100	10	10	70	10	45	2855	59.7/sec	142911.5
       









Observation : if load on  ClaimRootId is more  its taking more Response time ,in above scenario for 70 Threads  its having Max Response time as  17867 ms.

Neelima

Hi Gena/Amitava,


As discussed in standup call Yesterday regarding sent Bytes for Get Claims request, Please find the below work load distribution for 100 Users.

Request Details: [norgenhdpdev01]
Name of Request	No of Threads/Users	Ramp Up Time(Sec)	Ramp Up Steps Count 	Hold Target Rate Time [sec]	Duration
Assert
[ms]	Get Claim Search Type
Get Claims Schema  	100	5	10	10	2800	ClaimId, RootId,
MemberId, Schema

                                       






Response Details:


Label	Samples	Average Response in ms 	Min Response in ms	Max Response in ms	Std Dev	Error %	Throughput in sec	Received KB/sec	Sent
KB/sec	Avg Bytes
GetClaimSchema	122	2232	323	2730	609.57	0.0	1.7/sec	324.89	0.29	197138.0
ClaimMemberId -AmeriHealth	127	2087	303	2614	690.50	0.0	1.7/sec	19.08	0.34	11230.0
ClaimRootId -AmeriHealth	127	2164	493	2621	653.97	0.0	1.7/sec	10.02	0.37	5930
GetClaimByClaimID-AmeriHealth	922	2085	236	2628	670.58	0.0	12.6/sec	72.77	2.47	5930
Total	1298	2107	236	2730	667.10	0.0	17.7/sec	421.85	3.46	24420.4









o	KB/Sec: This indicates the amount of data downloaded from server during the performance test execution. In short, it is the Throughput measured in Kilobytes per second.

Observations: As Highlighted  GetClaimSchema has 197138.0 KB/sec amount of data download in any of distribution load of 100 users.

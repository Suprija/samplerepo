Hi Neelima â€“
Can you please help catch-up Suprija with whatever you have done so far in the following order:

(a)	Load Testing for application services
(b)	Performance (response time) for app-services
(c)	Core Platform Integration Testing Automation
(d)	App-services Integration Testing Automation
(e)	Any Documentation that we have built around this in the past.

Please feel free to juggle the order, add/modify items from the above list.

Let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks,
-Karthik

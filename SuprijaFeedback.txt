Suprija - FEEDBACK:
--------------------------
Tag Checked: v3

* GOOD JOB!
* Class Design is good.

--- QUESTIONS ---
* Git tags - where have they been created from (branch info)? How was it created?
	-> We don't have to tag frequently. Tags are done only when we are freezing the development & releasing something.

--- IMPROVEMENT AREAS ---

* Meaningful Git Commit Messages (not too lengthy but brief & meaningful)
* Meaningful artifact name in pom.xml. This controls the war file name and thereby your application name.
* Some kind of a status page after payment would have been nice (with a Home link).
* Profile page doesn't seem to be appropriate title.
* You don't have to have a member for PasswordConfirm.
* Code formatting can be consistent.
* No hard-coding of data in classes including test classes. Tests fail because of this.
* Add Comments to the Java Class and Methods following javadoc standards.
* Some failure cases could have been handled, like movie running house-full

* Need to add more UTs.

PENDING FROM MY SIDE FOR EVALUATION:
* Jenkins pipeline. Can you please share the config and email notificaiton?
* To review the Documentation.
